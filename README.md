## Retail Sales Analysis using Power BI

### Why I did this project
I worked on this project to understand how raw sales data can be converted into insights that actually help a business make better decisions. I chose a retail supermarket scenario because it involves multiple real-world challenges like inventory planning, customer behavior, and store-level performance tracking.

The dataset used is synthetic and created for academic and practice purposes.

### Business context
The business operates multiple retail stores and records hundreds of transactions every month. However, the management does not have a clear picture of:
- Which stores are performing well or poorly
- How sales change month by month
- Whether inventory levels are efficient
- Which customer segments contribute the most revenue

This lack of visibility makes decision-making difficult.

### What I worked on
Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that brings together revenue, inventory, and customer data in one place. The dashboard allows users to explore data dynamically instead of relying on static reports.

Key work includes:
- Creating KPIs for revenue, profit, and profit margin
- Segmenting customers into Gold, Silver, and Bronze categories based on spending
- Analyzing month-on-month revenue trends using a custom date table
- Comparing inventory levels with revenue to identify inefficiencies
- Designing an easy-to-understand dashboard layout with slicers

### Key insights from the analysis
- A few stores consistently generate higher revenue compared to others
- Some stores hold high inventory but generate relatively lower revenue
- Silver-category customers contribute the highest overall spending
- Monthly revenue shows noticeable seasonal patterns

### What a business could do next
Based on the analysis:
- Inventory levels can be adjusted for underperforming stores
- Marketing efforts can focus more on high-value customer segments
- Sales trends can be used to plan inventory more accurately in advance
